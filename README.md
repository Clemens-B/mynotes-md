# Markdown Note Taking App
build with [marked.js](https://github.com/chjj/marked), [ace editor](https://ace.c9.io/) and [prism.js](http://prismjs.com/) based on [Maxime's boilerplate](https://github.com/maximegris/angular-electron)

## Description
MyNotes.md is a markdown note taking app, which takes a lokal directory with markdown files, so you can edit them in an nice and easy way without opening a new instance of your IDE.

## Installation and Setup
1. [Download](https://github.com/Clemens-B/mynotes-md/releases) your OS-Version
2. Run it
4. Copy and Paste the absolute path to your markdown files in the input field

The directory can be any local folder. So you can use Dropbox and Google Drive too. E.g. "C:\Users\Clemens\Google Drive\Markdown-Notes"

**"Notebooks" are folders and "Notes" are markdown-files.** You can not put files in the root directory.

## Features
**1. Resizeable Elements**  
Drag an element to resize the viewable size of the element

**5. Copy and Paste code**  

**6. Emojis**  

**7. Collapseable Notebook Tree**

**7. Editor-Buttons for a quick insert** 

**8. Checkable list items**  
Click the checkbox on the rendered markdown to check an item. This will also change the raw markdown to "-[x] " or the opposite. **Note:** this feature searches for a string and replaces the third character before the string. So the square brackets have to follow by a space, e.g. "-[ ] ".
